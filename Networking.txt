Networking and Storage in Kubernetes

	#Kubernestes Networking Conditions
		
		1. Pods to Pods	
			All Pods on all nodes Can talk to each other without using Network address translation(NAT)
		
		2. Nodes to pods
			Nodes should be able to talk to their Pods without NAT
		
		3. Agents
			Agents on nodes such as kubelete can talk to all Nodes and Pods
			
			
	#Services
		1. Single entity
			One or more pods that perform same task are grouped together by using selector labels
		
		2. Endpoint
			When created, a service receives an Ip address, DNS name and IP port
			
		3. Internal and External
			Services provide access to pods from internal application or from external users
		
		# 3 types of service
			
			1. clusterIP
				Adds internal IP to Pods
			
			2. nodePort
				Adds static port to Pods
			
			3. LoadBalancer
				Uses Cloud-provided load balancer for external access
			
		# Volumes
			Ephemeral
				-Lifetime follows the pods
				-Loses data when Pod is destroyed
				-will not lose data if container restarts
				-used for temporary data like cache
			
			persistent
				-Lifetime does not follow pods
				-will not lose data when pod is destroyed
				-Used for databases and messaging queues
